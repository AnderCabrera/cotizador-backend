# Instalation
First we need to clone the repository and enter to the project folder.

Now we need to change the credentials for the database inside the [*application.properties*](./src/main/resources/application.properties) file.

Then we run the [*database*](./database/CotizadorEnvios.sql)

*Remember to be in the main project folder.*

After that, we can start the server with the following command.

> Windows
```powershell
.\mvnw
```

> Linux
```bash
./mvnw
```
